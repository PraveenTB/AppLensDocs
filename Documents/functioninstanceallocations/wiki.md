This query determines how many VMs are allocated to be running the function app and compares that to how many instances are actually executing functions. These numbers won't always match - for example if the function app is using an event hub trigger then the maximum number of VMs that trigger can be running on is equal to the number of partitions that event hub was configured with. Another scenario might be that one or more workers have gone into a bad state and aren't executing functions anymore.
